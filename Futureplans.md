This software is almost ready to be able to fly a rocket, all I have to do is make it more stable and instead of flashing LEDS, it outputs a pin.

Some things I want to do in the future:

Sd logging, with gyroscope and other things, will be important if the rocket somehow fails but I have information.
Abort system, if something is dectected wrong, it cancles the flight. Like if it detects high winds or the rocket moving before launch.
Bluetooth control. I would like to use bluetooth to click a button from my phone and launch it.
