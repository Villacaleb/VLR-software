# VLR-software
the software for VLR

VLR, Villa Lite Rocket will be a model rocket powered by a homemade E class sugar engine.

in this version (0.4). you press a push button (one that is on all the time and only off when you hold it down) then it starts the servo testing.
After the servo testing, the servo(s) move in their final place.
30 seconds later the arduino will power the ingiter (for now its the on board led blinking).
10 seconds after launch (which may change once I do a better engine count) the parachute releases by the servo.
7 seconds later, enough time to let it fall back to the ground, the servo will start moving again to test and make sure it still works.
